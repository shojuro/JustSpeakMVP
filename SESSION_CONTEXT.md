# Session Context - Just Speak MVP

## Current Status: Bug Fixes Implemented ✓

### Issues Fixed

1. **Dashboard Time Tracking** ✓
   - Problem: Duration value was getting reset when recording stopped
   - Solution: Added `recordingDurationRef` to preserve duration value
   - Implementation:
     - Added `recordingDurationRef = useRef<number>(0)` in ChatInterface
     - Save duration when transcript is processed: `recordingDurationRef.current = duration`
     - Use saved duration for messages and API calls
   - Result: Dashboard now accurately tracks speaking time

2. **Feedback Page Session Refresh** ✓
   - Problem: Sessions weren't refreshing when navigating back from chat
   - Solution: Added visibility and focus event listeners
   - Implementation:
     - Refresh sessions when page becomes visible
     - Refresh sessions when window gains focus
     - Preserve selected session if it still exists
   - Result: Feedback page always shows current sessions

### Authentication Status (Previously Fixed)
- Cookie-based authentication: Working ✓
- Supabase SSR: Configured ✓
- API routes: Authenticated ✓
- Session state management: Fixed ✓

### Features Completed
1. Dashboard functionality tracking talk time ✓
2. Feedback document with conversations and corrections ✓
3. ESL Error Hierarchy implementation (levels 1-4 prioritized) ✓
4. Natural conversation flow (no inline corrections) ✓

### Important Design Decisions
- Users NEVER see errors/corrections during chat
- Corrections only appear in separate feedback document
- AI responds naturally to what it understands
- Focus on ESL hierarchy levels 1-4 (Word Order, Word Form, Verb Tense, Prepositions)

### Files Modified in This Session
1. `/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`:
   - Added `recordingDurationRef` to preserve recording duration
   - Updated transcript handling to save duration before reset
   - Updated message sending to use saved duration

2. `/src/app/feedback/page.tsx`:
   - Added visibility change event listener
   - Added window focus event listener
   - Updated session loading to preserve selection

### Next Steps
1. Commit and push the bug fixes
2. Test on Vercel deployment
3. Consider implementing real speech-to-text (currently placeholder)
4. Future: PDF export option for feedback documents

### Database Schema
- `user_progress`: Tracks daily speaking time
- `sessions`: Speaking practice sessions
- `messages`: Conversation history
- `corrections`: Error analysis (not shown inline)

All features use Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation.
