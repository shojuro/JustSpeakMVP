# Session Context - Just Speak MVP

## Current Status: Critical Issues Found in Testing ⚠️

### Latest Test Results (2025-07-29)

#### What Works ✓
- Recording functionality (100+ seconds recorded successfully)
- Transcript generation via OpenAI Whisper
- AI conversation responses
- Message looping issue fixed
- Basic chat functionality

#### What's Broken ✗
1. **Dashboard Time Tracking Not Working**
   - Speaking time not saved to database
   - user_progress API returning 500 errors repeatedly
   - Dashboard shows 0:00 despite successful recordings

2. **Feedback Page Issues**
   - No new transcripts appearing
   - Old transcripts from previous attempts remain
   - Sessions are created but corrections not being saved

3. **API Errors in Console**
   - `api/user-progress: 500` - Failed to update progress (multiple times)
   - `user_progress?select=*...&date=eq.2025-07-29: 406` - Query expecting single result
   - `manifest.json: 401` - PWA manifest unauthorized on Vercel

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Dashboard Query Issue**
   ```typescript
   // Current code uses .single() which fails when no record exists
   .eq('date', today)
   .single()  // This causes 406 when no record exists
   
   // Should be:
   .maybeSingle()  // Returns null if no record
   ```

2. **User Progress API Authentication**
   - API is using server-side auth but may have context issues
   - Date handling might be inconsistent between client and server
   - Need to verify authentication flow matches other working APIs

3. **Database Schema Issue**
   - user_progress table expects unique (user_id, date) constraint
   - Insert/update logic may be failing due to constraint violations

### Console Logs from Test

```

### Issues Fixed Previously
1. ✓ Authentication (cookie-based SSR)
2. ✓ Message looping (transcript clearing)
3. ✓ Session management
4. ✓ Feedback page refresh

### Action Plan for Next Session

1. **Fix Dashboard Queries** (dashboard/page.tsx):
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   .single()
   // To:
   .maybeSingle()
   ```

2. **Fix User Progress API** (api/user-progress/route.ts):
   - Update authentication to match working patterns
   - Add detailed error logging
   - Fix date handling consistency
   - Handle insert/update conflicts properly

3. **Debug Progress Tracking**:
   - Add console logs to trace exact failure point
   - Verify database constraints
   - Check date format consistency

4. **Fix PWA Manifest**:
   - Check public directory setup
   - Verify manifest.json accessibility
   - Update next.config.js if needed

### Database Schema Reference
- `user_progress`: Tracks daily speaking time
  - Unique constraint on (user_id, date)
  - Fields: total_speaking_time, total_messages, error_counts
- `sessions`: Speaking practice sessions
- `messages`: Conversation history
- `corrections`: Error analysis (not shown inline)

### Files to Modify Next
1. `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fix queries
2. `/src/app/api/user-progress/route.ts` - Fix auth and error handling
3. `/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` - Add more logging if needed
4. `/public/manifest.json` - Verify accessibility

### Important Notes
- All basic functionality works except progress tracking
- The issue is specifically with saving/retrieving user progress data
- Authentication is working (user can record and chat)
- This is likely a simple fix in the API endpoint and dashboard queries
