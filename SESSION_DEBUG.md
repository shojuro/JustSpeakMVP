# Session Debug Information

## Issue Found
The chat API is failing because it can't find the session in the database. The error "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned" indicates the session doesn't exist.

## Possible Causes
1. Session is not being created properly in the frontend
2. Session ID is being generated but not saved to the database
3. There's a timing issue where the chat is attempted before the session is saved

## Temporary Workaround
If you need to use the app immediately while we investigate:

1. Try refreshing the page after logging in
2. Check if a new session is created
3. If not, log out and log back in

## What's Fixed
- Changed the query from `.single()` to handle multiple or no results
- Added detailed logging to understand what's happening
- The app will now give more specific error messages

## Next Steps
Once deployed, the logs will show:
- Whether the session exists in the database
- If there are duplicate sessions
- The exact session ID being used
