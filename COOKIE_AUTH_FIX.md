# Cookie-Based Authentication Fix

## Problem Identified
The server was trying to validate auth tokens from headers, but Supabase SSR (Server-Side Rendering) actually uses cookies for authentication. The auth header approach wasn't working because the server-side client needs to use the cookie-based auth flow.

## Solution
1. **Removed auth header logic**: The server now uses the built-in cookie authentication
2. **Simplified auth check**: Uses `supabase.auth.getUser()` which automatically reads auth cookies
3. **Added debug logging**: To identify if sessions exist but RLS policies are blocking access
4. **Updated session query**: Now explicitly filters by both session ID and user ID

## Key Changes
- Server uses cookie-based auth instead of Bearer tokens
- Client still logs auth status but doesn't send unnecessary headers
- Better error logging to diagnose RLS policy issues

## What This Fixes
- Server can now properly identify authenticated users
- Session queries include user context for RLS policies
- Debug logs will show if sessions exist but are blocked by policies

## Next Steps
After deployment, the logs will show:
- Whether the server can authenticate users via cookies
- If sessions exist in the database
- Whether RLS policies are blocking access
