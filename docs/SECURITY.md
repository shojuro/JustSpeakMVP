# Security Policy

## üîê Security First Approach

Just Speak MVP is built with security as a primary concern. This document outlines our security measures and best practices.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Developers

### Environment Variables and Secrets Management

**CRITICAL**: Never commit real API keys, passwords, or secrets to version control!

1. **Use `.env` files for local development** - These are gitignored and safe for secrets
2. **Use `.env.example` for structure only** - Only contains placeholder values
3. **Rotate credentials immediately if exposed** - Even if accidentally committed locally
4. **Use strong, unique secrets** - Generate random strings for JWT secrets and encryption keys

### What to do if credentials are exposed:
1. **Immediately revoke/regenerate all exposed credentials**
2. **Update your local `.env` file with new credentials**
3. **Check Git history to ensure secrets weren't committed**
4. **If committed, clean Git history before pushing**
5. **Notify the team of the security incident**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie configuration, automatic token refresh
- **Password Policy**: Bcrypt hashing with minimum 10 rounds
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks on auth endpoints

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS only)
- **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- **API Security**: All endpoints require authentication
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all user inputs

### Infrastructure Security
- **Headers**: Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **CORS**: Strict CORS policy allowing only authorized origins
- **Environment Variables**: Secrets stored securely, never in code
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits with npm audit

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email us at: security@justspeakmvp.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours and work on a fix immediately.

## üìã Security Checklist

### Development
- [ ] Never commit secrets or API keys
- [ ] Always validate and sanitize user input
- [ ] Use parameterized queries (Prisma/Supabase handles this)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without exposing system details
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated

### Deployment
- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

### Code Review
- [ ] Check for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Verify input validation
- [ ] Review authentication logic
- [ ] Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify XSS prevention measures

## üîí Data Privacy

### What We Collect
- Email address (for authentication)
- Speaking recordings (temporarily, for transcription only)
- Session metadata (duration, timestamps)

### What We DON'T Store
- Raw audio recordings (deleted after transcription)
- Payment information (handled by Stripe)
- Personal identification information

### Data Retention
- User data: Until account deletion
- Session data: 90 days
- Logs: 30 days

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Development
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Catches common vulnerabilities
- **npm audit**: Checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **TypeScript**: Type safety prevents many vulnerabilities

### Production
- **Cloudflare**: DDoS protection and WAF
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and monitoring
- **Vercel**: Secure hosting with automatic HTTPS

- [ ] SOC 2 compliance

### Phase 3 (Scale)
- [ ] Enterprise SSO
- [ ] Advanced encryption
- [ ] Compliance certifications
- [ ] Bug bounty program
