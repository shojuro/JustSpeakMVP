# Error Analysis and Progress Tracking Fix

## Date: 2025-07-30

### Issues Fixed
1. Dashboard showing 0:00 speaking time and 0 messages despite active conversations
2. Feedback page showing "No significant errors found" despite grammatical errors in transcripts

### Root Cause
The `analyze-errors` API endpoint was never being called from ChatInterface.tsx. This API is responsible for:
- Analyzing user messages for ESL errors using GPT-4
- Saving corrections to the database
- Updating user progress with speaking time and error counts

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Added analyze-errors API call (src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx)
- Added API call after user message is saved but before AI response
- Sends messageId, userId, sessionId, content, and duration
- Logs analysis results (error count and primary errors)
- Handles failures gracefully without blocking chat flow

#### 2. Fixed .single() error in analyze-errors (src/app/api/analyze-errors/route.ts)
- Changed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` on line 156
- Prevents errors when no user_progress record exists for today
- Allows first-time daily usage to work correctly

#### 3. Removed redundant user-progress call (src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx)
- Removed separate user-progress API call since analyze-errors handles it
- Prevents duplicate progress updates
- Simplifies the flow

### How It Works Now

1. User speaks and message is transcribed
2. Message is saved to database
3. **NEW: analyze-errors API is called to:**
   - Analyze grammar using GPT-4
   - Save corrections to corrections table
   - Update user_progress with time and error counts
4. Chat API is called for AI response
5. Session is updated with total speaking time

### Expected Results

1. **Dashboard**: Will show accurate speaking time and message counts
2. **Feedback Page**: Will show grammatical corrections for user messages
3. **Progress Tracking**: Error types and counts will be tracked properly

### Testing Instructions

1. Login as authenticated user
2. Have a conversation with grammatical errors
3. Check dashboard - should show speaking time and messages
4. Check feedback page - should show corrections for errors
5. Database should have:
   - Corrections in corrections table
   - User progress in user_progress table

### Technical Details

The analyze-errors API uses:
- GPT-4 for error analysis
- Focus on top 4 ESL error types:
  - Word Order
  - Word Form
  - Verb Tense
  - Prepositions
- Saves detailed analysis as JSON
- Updates daily progress aggregates
