# Immediate Fix for Chat Not Working

## The Issue
You have multiple active sessions (with NULL ended_at) but the app is trying to use an old session ID that may not be the most recent one.

## Quick Fix - Do This Now:

### Option 1: End All Sessions and Start Fresh
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- End all your current sessions
UPDATE sessions 
SET ended_at = NOW() 
WHERE user_id = '044a4734-6ff1-465e-879a-544859605cfa' 
AND ended_at IS NULL;
```

Then refresh the app - it will create a new session.

### Option 2: Use the Most Recent Session
The code has been updated to always use the most recent active session, so once deployed, it should work.

## Why This Happened
1. Multiple sessions were created without properly ending the previous ones
2. The frontend was holding onto an old session ID
3. The session verification was too strict with `.single()`

## Prevention
The updated code will:
- Handle multiple active sessions gracefully
- Always use the most recent session
- Give better error messages
