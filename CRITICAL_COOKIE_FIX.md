# Critical Cookie Authentication Fix

## Root Cause Identified

From the Vercel logs, the server is NOT receiving authenticated user data:

- `[Chat API] Authenticated user from cookies: undefined`
- `[Chat API] No authenticated user found`

This means cookies aren't being passed from the browser to the API route.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Direct Cookie Access**: API route now directly creates Supabase client with cookie store
2. **Cookie Debugging**: Added logging to see which auth cookies are present
3. **Credentials Include**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to ensure cookies are sent with fetch

## Key Changes

1. **In API Route**:
   - Uses `createServerClient` directly with cookie store
   - Logs all auth-related cookies for debugging
   - Properly reads auth cookies from the request

2. **In apiFetch**:
   - Added `credentials: 'include'` to send cookies with requests
   - This ensures browser sends auth cookies to API

## What This Should Fix

- Server will now receive auth cookies from the browser
- Auth cookies will be properly parsed
- User authentication will work on the server side

## Debug Information

The logs will now show:

- Which auth cookies are present
- Whether they contain values
- If the user can be authenticated from cookies

This is the critical fix for the authentication flow.
