# Clock Skew Authentication Fix

## The Problem

Your authentication was failing with this error:
```
@supabase/gotrue-js: Session as retrieved from URL was issued in the future? 
Check the device clock for skew 1753460544 1753464144 1753460543
```

This indicates your device clock is approximately **1 hour behind** the server time, causing all authentication attempts to fail.

## What I Implemented

### 1. **Clock Skew Detection**
- Created utility functions to detect time differences between client and server
- Shows a warning banner when clock skew is detected
- Provides clear instructions to fix the issue

### 2. **Server Time Endpoint**
- Added `/api/time` endpoint to get accurate server time
- Used for comparing with local device time

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Updated all auth components to detect clock skew errors
- Shows specific error messages about clock issues
- Provides step-by-step fix instructions

### 4. **System Check Page**
- Created `/system-check` page for comprehensive diagnostics
- Shows clock sync status, auth status, and Supabase connection
- Helps troubleshoot various authentication issues

## How to Fix Your Clock Issue

### Windows:
1. Right-click on the time in your taskbar
2. Select "Adjust date/time"
3. Turn ON "Set time automatically"
4. Turn ON "Set time zone automatically"
5. Click "Sync now" under "Synchronize your clock"

### Alternative Windows Fix:
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Run: `w32tm /resync`

### Mac:
1. Open System Preferences â†’ Date & Time
2. Check "Set date and time automatically"

### Linux:
1. Install ntp: `sudo apt-get install ntp`
2. Sync time: `sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov`

## Features Added

1. **Clock Skew Warning Banner**
   - Appears at the top of all pages when clock skew detected
   - Can be dismissed but reappears on page reload
   - Shows exact time difference

2. **Better Error Messages**
   - Login form shows clock-specific errors
   - Auth callback page shows detailed fix instructions
   - All errors mention clock issues when relevant

3. **System Check Page** (`/system-check`)
   - Real-time clock synchronization check
   - Supabase connection status
   - Authentication status
   - Browser information

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit `/system-check` to see all system statuses
2. If clock skew is detected, fix your system time
3. After fixing, refresh the page
4. Try logging in again

## Why This Happened

JWT tokens (used by Supabase for authentication) include timestamps. When your device clock is wrong:
- Tokens appear to be "from the future"
- Supabase rejects them as invalid
- All authentication fails, even with correct credentials

## Prevention

- Keep "Set time automatically" enabled on your device
- Regularly sync your system time
- Use the `/system-check` page if you encounter auth issues

The authentication system now gracefully handles clock skew and provides clear guidance to users experiencing this issue.
