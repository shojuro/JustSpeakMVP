# Debug Steps for Authenticated User Chat Issues

## Current Situation

- ✅ Anonymous users can chat successfully
- ❌ Authenticated users get "I couldn't process that" errors
- ✅ All environment variables are configured correctly
- ✅ Database tables exist (corrections, user_progress)

## Next Debugging Steps

### 1. Test the App Again

Once the new logging is deployed, test as an authenticated user and check the Vercel logs for:

- `[ChatInterface] Creating or getting session`
- `[ChatInterface] Sending message`
- `[Chat API] Request received`
- `[Chat API] Session verification`

### 2. Check Browser Console

When you get the error, look for:

- Network tab: Check if the `/api/chat` request returns 403, 500, or another error
- Console tab: Look for any error messages

### 3. Possible Causes

#### Session Creation Issue

If sessions aren't being created properly for authenticated users, messages can't be saved.

#### Database Permission Issue

Even though tables exist, there might be RLS (Row Level Security) issues preventing message insertion.

#### Error Analysis Trigger

The ESL error analysis (triggered every 3rd message) might be failing for authenticated users.

## Quick Test

Try this in your browser console when logged in:

```javascript
// Check if session exists
console.log('Current session:', sessionStorage.getItem('currentSession'))
```

## Temporary Workaround

If needed, we can temporarily disable the error analysis feature to see if that's causing the issue.
