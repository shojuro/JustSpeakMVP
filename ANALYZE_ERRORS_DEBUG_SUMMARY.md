# Analyze Errors Debug Summary

## Changes Made (2025-07-30)

### 1. Enhanced Logging in analyze-errors API

- Already had comprehensive logging throughout the flow
- Added OpenAI API key validation logging (lines 127-128)
- Added try-catch specifically for OpenAI API calls (lines 131-165)
- Returns more detailed error info if OpenAI fails

### 2. Created Debug Endpoint

- `/api/debug-openai` - Checks if OpenAI API key is configured
- Safe endpoint that doesn't expose the actual key
- Shows: configured status, key length, if it starts with 'sk-'

### 3. Verified Logging in ChatInterface

- Already has detailed logging for analyze-errors call
- Logs payload, response status, and results
- Proper error handling with stack traces

## How to Debug the Issue

1. **Check OpenAI API Key**:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug-openai
   ```

2. **Monitor Console Logs**:
   When a user speaks, you should see:

   ```
   [ChatInterface] Starting error analysis for message: {...}
   [ChatInterface] Calling analyze-errors API with payload: {...}
   [analyze-errors] API endpoint called
   [analyze-errors] OpenAI API key configured: true/false
   [analyze-errors] Calling OpenAI for analysis...
   ```

3. **Check for Errors**:
   - If OpenAI API key is missing: Will log "OpenAI API key configured: false"
   - If OpenAI API fails: Will log detailed error with status/code
   - If database update fails: Will log specific Supabase error

## Next Steps

1. **Run the app and test**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the flow**:
   - Login/signup
   - Go to chat
   - Speak a message with grammatical errors
   - Check browser console for logs
   - Check terminal console for API logs

3. **Verify in browser console**:
   - Look for `[ChatInterface]` logs
   - Check if analyze-errors response has `success: true`

4. **Check database**:
   - corrections table should have new entries
   - user_progress table should update

## Common Issues

1. **Missing OPENAI_API_KEY**: Check `.env` file
2. **Invalid API key**: Verify key starts with 'sk-' and is valid
3. **Rate limiting**: OpenAI may rate limit requests
4. **Model availability**: gpt-4-turbo-preview must be available

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check if API is healthy
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check OpenAI config
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug-openai

# Check current user progress
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user-progress \
  -H "Cookie: [your-auth-cookies]"
```
