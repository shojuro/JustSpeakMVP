# Audio Processing Fix for Authenticated Users

## Date: 2025-07-30

### Issue Fixed
"Failed to process audio. Please try again." error occurring only for authenticated users when using push-to-talk feature.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by a race condition where:
1. Authenticated users need a session before recording
2. Session creation/validation was happening asynchronously
3. Recording could start before session was ready
4. This caused the audio processing to fail

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Error Logging (src/hooks/useSpeechRecording.ts)
- Added detailed response status and headers logging
- Enhanced error object logging with blob details
- More descriptive error messages for users

#### 2. Session Readiness Check (src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx)
- Added `sessionLoading` state to track session initialization
- Prevent recording until session is ready for authenticated users
- Disable speak button while session is loading
- Show helpful message if user tries to record before session is ready

#### 3. Retry Logic for Transcription (src/hooks/useSpeechRecording.ts)
- Implemented automatic retry (up to 2 attempts) for network failures
- Added 1-second delay between retries
- Retry only for transient errors (network, timeout, fetch failures)

### Code Changes

1. **useSpeechRecording.ts**:
   - Enhanced error logging in transcribeAudio function
   - Added retry logic with MAX_RETRIES = 2
   - Better error messages with actual error details

2. **ChatInterface.tsx**:
   - Added sessionLoading state
   - Modified SpeakButton to check session readiness
   - Disabled recording until session is initialized

### User Experience Improvements

1. **For Authenticated Users**:
   - Recording button is disabled until session is ready
   - Clear feedback if they try to record too early
   - Automatic retry on network failures
   - Better error messages explaining what went wrong

2. **For All Users**:
   - More resilient audio processing
   - Automatic recovery from transient failures
   - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### Testing Instructions

1. **Test as Authenticated User**:
   - Login to the application
   - Go to chat page
   - Observe that speak button is disabled briefly while session loads
   - Once enabled, test recording - should work without errors

2. **Test as Unauthenticated User**:
   - Use chat without logging in
   - Recording should work immediately
   - No session loading delay

3. **Test Error Recovery**:
   - Try recording with poor network connection
   - Should see retry attempts in console
   - Should eventually succeed or show clear error message

### Next Steps

- Monitor for any edge cases
- Consider adding visual loading indicator for session initialization
- May want to add session pre-loading on page load for faster readiness
