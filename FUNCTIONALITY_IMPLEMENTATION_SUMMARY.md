# Functionality Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. ✅ Dashboard Talk Time Tracking

- **Created**: `/api/user-progress` endpoint to track daily speaking time
- **Updated**: ChatInterface now calls this API after each recording
- **Result**: Dashboard accurately displays daily and weekly speaking time

### 2. ✅ Feedback Document System

- **Created**: `/app/feedback/page.tsx` - dedicated feedback page
- **Features**:
  - Session selector to choose practice sessions
  - Full conversation transcript with timestamps
  - Corrections table (no inline display during chat)
  - ESL hierarchy-based improvement summary
  - Download feedback as text file

### 3. ✅ ESL Error Hierarchy Implementation

- **Hierarchy Levels**:
  1. Word Order
  2. Word Form
  3. Verb Tense
  4. Prepositions
  5. Articles & Agreement
  6. Pronouns
  7. Spelling & Punctuation

- **Behavior**: Top 3 areas focus on levels 1-4 first
- **No visual corrections during chat** - maintains natural conversation flow

### 4. ✅ Dashboard Integration

- Added "View Conversation Feedback" button on dashboard
- Links directly to the feedback page

## How It Works

1. **During Conversation**:
   - User speaks naturally with AI
   - No error highlighting or corrections shown
   - AI responds to what it understands (like real conversation)
   - Speaking time tracked automatically

2. **After Practice**:
   - User can access feedback via dashboard
   - Select any session to review
   - See full transcript, corrections, and improvement areas
   - Download feedback for offline review

3. **Improvement Focus**:
   - System prioritizes ESL hierarchy levels 1-4
   - Provides specific tips for each error type
   - Tracks progress over time

## Database Updates

- `user_progress` table now properly tracks daily speaking time
- `corrections` table stores error analysis without showing inline
- All data properly secured with RLS policies

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. Real speech-to-text integration (currently using placeholder)
2. PDF export option for feedback documents
3. Teacher/parent access roles
4. Progress graphs and visualizations
