# Debug Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented comprehensive debugging and verification tools to identify why the dashboard shows 0:00 and corrections aren't being saved.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logging in analyze-errors API
- Added request IDs for tracking requests through the system
- Detailed logging at each step of the process
- Logs which Supabase client is being used (service role vs regular)
- Returns debug information in development mode
- Tracks success/failure of each database operation

### 2. Debug Endpoints

#### `/api/debug-progress`
- Tests both regular and service role clients
- Shows all user_progress records
- Provides comparison between clients
- Includes summary statistics
- Query params: `?userId=xxx&date=xxx&days=7`

#### `/api/debug-corrections`
- Tests both regular and service role clients
- Shows all corrections records
- Provides error type analysis
- Checks if corrections table exists
- Query params: `?userId=xxx&sessionId=xxx&messageId=xxx&limit=20`

#### `/api/system-health`
- Comprehensive health check of the entire system
- Checks environment variables
- Verifies database connectivity and tables
- Tests OpenAI API connection
- Validates service role key matches project
- Provides recommendations for fixes

### 3. Dashboard Debug Mode
- Access with `?debug=true` query parameter
- Shows real-time debug information
- Displays API responses from debug endpoints
- Shows current dashboard data
- Quick links to debug APIs
- Error display panel

### 4. Request Tracking
- Added request IDs to ChatInterface
- Tracks analyze-errors API calls
- Logs debug responses in development
- Better error detail logging

## How to Use

### 1. Check System Health
```
Visit: /api/system-health
```
This will show:
- If service role key matches the project
- If all database tables exist
- If OpenAI is configured correctly
- Overall system status

### 2. Debug Dashboard
```
Visit: /dashboard?debug=true
```
This will show:
- Debug panel at bottom of dashboard
- Data from both regular and service role clients
- Any errors encountered
- Current dashboard state

### 3. Test Individual APIs
```
# Check user progress data
/api/debug-progress?userId=YOUR_USER_ID

# Check corrections data
/api/debug-corrections?userId=YOUR_USER_ID

# Check specific session
/api/debug-sessions?sessionId=YOUR_SESSION_ID
```

### 4. Monitor Console Logs
When using the chat interface, look for:
- `[ChatInterface][req_xxx]` - Request tracking
- `[analyze-errors][req_xxx]` - API processing
- Debug info in responses (development mode)

## Expected Findings

The debug tools will reveal:
1. Whether the service role key is valid and matches the project
2. Whether database operations are succeeding or failing
3. Which client (regular vs service role) is being used
4. Whether data exists but isn't being queried correctly
5. Specific error messages and codes

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to Vercel
2. Access `/api/system-health` to check configuration
3. Have a conversation with grammar errors
4. Check `/dashboard?debug=true` to see if data is saved
5. Review debug endpoint responses to identify the exact issue
6. Fix based on findings (likely service role key mismatch)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Service Role Key Mismatch
**Symptom**: system-health shows projectMatch: false
**Solution**: Get correct service role key from Supabase dashboard

### Missing Tables
**Symptom**: system-health shows some tables don't exist
**Solution**: Run migrations 002 and 003

### RLS Policy Failures
**Symptom**: Regular client fails but service client works
**Solution**: Either fix RLS policies or ensure service role key is configured

### OpenAI API Failures
**Symptom**: analyze-errors fails at OpenAI step
**Solution**: Check OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
